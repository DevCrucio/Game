# The Game
The Game i'm developing doesn't have any name for now. Suggestions are welcome.</br>
It will be a Sandbox Platformer (like Terraria and Starbound) with a gameplay more compared to Magicite and a big variety of Fight/Heal spells to use.</br>

### Features
-Multiplayer (Client-Server)</br>
-Smooth Movement</br>
-Chunk System (Saved and generated Serverside)</br>

### Todo
-Inventory System</br>
-Block Place and Break</br>

### Idea
-No Air to breathe on the World</br>
-Start with Air for 1 Minute in oxygen mask</br>
-Air can be reloaded in Air Compressor</br>
-Rooms can be filled with Air by Air Valve</br>
-Need energy to Generate Air</br>
